-----------MAIN.CPP IS THE ONLY FILE--------------

have cut all the extra features except irc client-server interaction & all the windows-exclusive tools.

have been trying to port the remains from winsock to socket.h in Mint.

have not yet finished, but expected to wrap it up soon.

sources for mptcp implementaion weigh 7 GBs. too much. i could install this on one of the machines, but i doubt if my ssd would like it.
